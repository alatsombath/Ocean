CPU intensive: Decrease the width, the number of bands, or update frequency to increase performance in exchange for an overall loss in viewing size, precision, and fluidity

You can change the width, line width, height, sensitivity, number of bands (peaks), and color through the "Edit variables" context menu option

Clarification: The "Wave" visualizer is not an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> (sine wave or time-domain signal). It simply plots intepolated frequency band values as points connected by a smooth line
